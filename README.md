A simple template project to provide software to ESCAPE.

It shows the **basic documentation** a project should include, following the [opensource guide](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/):

* An [open source](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#where-does-the-license-live-on-my-repository) **license**.
* A [**README** file](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo#commit-your-first-change), similar to this one. 
* Contributing guidelines (see below).
* A code of conduct (TBD).
* The structure of the repository.
* It would be highly suitable to include too:
   - A setup file to install the library.
   - A .gitignore file.
   - Unitary and integration tests.
   
**Please feel free to copy / base on / template this project!** (Look to left of the `Clone or download` button in the [GitHub](https://github.com/garciagenrique/template_project_escape) site).

Take few minutes to check the [ESCAPE repository's guidelines](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/escape2020/guidelines) too.

# Contributing guidelines

If you wish to provide software to the ESCAPE repository, you should ask developer access through the Gitlab interface and send an email to vuillaume [at] lapp.in2p3.fr with your institution email.

You will then be able to open a new project and transfer code.

All the code provided should be uploaded from the [zenodo ESCAPE community](https://zenodo.org/communities/escape2020/). 

For a detailed explanation of how to submit a contribution to a project / repository (Fork, create a branch, make a pull request...), please check the [opensource guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution) and/or the [git's documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

Once you are granted with developer access, you will be able to add a new blank project / import it (from other common repository managers, i.e., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Fogbugz...) to the [GitLab/ESCAPE](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/escape2020) main page.

-  ***PLEASE NOTE*** that if you have login GitLab by using the `[Shibbolenth]` service (eduGAIN, Fédération d'Identités RENATER), you will need to [add a SSH key](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair) to your GitLab profile if you want to 'push' your changes to the server.
