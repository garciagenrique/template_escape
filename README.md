A simple example project to be used as a template.

It shows the **basic documentation** a project should include, following the [opensource guide](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/):

* An [open source](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#where-does-the-license-live-on-my-repository) **license**.
* A **README** [file](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo#commit-your-first-change), similar to this one. 
* Contributing guidelines (see below).
* A code of conduct (TBD).
* It would be higly suitable to include too:
   - A setup file to install the library.
   - A .gitignore file.
   - The structure of the repository within a file with same name as the project.
   - Unitary and integration test.
   
**Please feel free to copy / base on / template this project!** (Look to left of the `Clone or download` button).

Take few minutes to check the [ESCAPE repository's guidelines](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/escape2020/guidelines) too.
